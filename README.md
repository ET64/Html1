HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
So... if you want to create webpages you should first learn html, then css and javascript.
HTML is so easy, you'll learn everything you need to know in about html in 2 weeks.
I recommend for beginners w3schools to learn about html. There are also other apps to learn like sololearn, etc. but I
personally recommend w3schools.



Instructions:
Copy the contents of "HTML.html" to your default text editor(notepad++, atom, notepad, etc.) then press ctrl + s,
if you're on notepad change the encoding to utf-8, the "Save as type" panel to all files and change the name to HTML.html
and also save the file to C:\Users\username\Desktop.
Download the other files and save them to C:\Users\username\Desktop.
Finally, open the file in your default browser.
